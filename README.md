# PyroCMS IGDB Field Type
This Field Type for PyroCMS 3 allows to select/ search and fetch Games from [IGDB API](https://igdb.github.io/api/) 
for use in PyroCMS. Once fetched from the API the data is cached in a Stream to reduce necessary API calls.

In order to use the API you must register your app at https://api.igdb.com/.

This is NOT a official implementation by the crators of the [IGDB API](https://igdb.github.io/api/)
